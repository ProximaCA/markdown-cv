# **Fullstack Developer & AI Builder**

## Profile

A full-stack engineer with 3+ years of experience building production-ready systems: Telegram Mini Apps, AI-powered platforms, backend architectures, automation pipelines, and blockchain-based applications. Comfortable taking projects from raw idea to a deployed MVP with proper architecture, clean code, security, and maintainability.
Strong focus on AI agents, scalable backend logic, automation, and blockchain (TON & EVM). I enjoy solving messy problems, shipping fast, designing systems that don’t fall apart under load, and iterating until it feels right.

Currently working as CPO & Fullstack Engineer at **Tonify**, building the core platform logic, architecture, and AI/blockchain integrations.
